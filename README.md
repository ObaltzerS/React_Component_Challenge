Create a simple web application that is responsive and can be used on a mobile device browser as well as on the desktop. You will use React/Next as the frameworks and Tailwind for style. The app will be a simple interface but you should style it nicely to show your capabilities and understanding there. 

The app will have a button in the lower right hand corner that adds a new item to an infinitely scrolling list that fills out the rest of the page above the button. To the left of the button is a count of items in the list. When the button is pressed a new item will appear in the list. The item can be whatever you want (such as a random U.S. address or a fake contact) but should be sortable in some way so that it is added to the list at the right spot. The list should scroll to the new item and visually indicate that it is new. Each item will have a delete button and remove them from the list. 

We would look for:

Modularity â€” use components where it makes sense to
Code / project structure
Working code

Features:

infinite scroll must scroll to the newly added item
sort list
delete items from list
